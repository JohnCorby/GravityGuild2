- bigger radius for wither skulls? and higher knockback from above

# other

- armor that does something (e.g. small durability but resistant to arrows)
- notify on reach lethal velocity for wall/floor hit??? or remove that entirely
- custom killer tracker: any hit you get on them and then they die will count within n seconds of their hit. maybe track who did the most damage if theres multiple
- DONE-ISH: let players have more air control, while still requiring them to be grounded
- higher gravity? limited rockets per air? higher knockback from skull/fireball?
- tunnel via breaking blocks while gliding?

# bow

- arrow explode strength stronger for faster arrow. this makes spamming short range really hard
- bigger hitbox for flying players so you can hit them. but they stick to walls to go up, so explosion damage makes them more vulnerable there too
- arrows have no gravity, weaker explosion. tnt have gravity like grenade, stronger explosion
- cooldown on bow shots? overpowered

# tnt

- short/medium range big explosion guy
- tnt left click to throw
- snow in ground, tnt too maybe occasionally. this means ability to break blocks instead of shoot skull

# trident?

- cause fire ticks, harms flying significantly
- reason for melee weapon? make it knockback. this should make it possible to hit and then impair their movement. could chain well with range

# mace

- wind charge
    - GOOD: wind charges work really well. explosion on arrow is more forgiving then insta kill perfect aim move wind charge to separate item to enforce switch? UPDATE: kinda meh custom wind charge hit response (manually set velocity). rn its kinda finicky. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THIS CURRENTLY
- wider range for mace hit. bounce. will try. might want a way to block/
