- bigger radius for wither skulls? and higher knockback from above

# other

- armor that does something (e.g. small durability but resistant to arrows)
- custom killer tracker: any hit you get on them and then they die will count within n seconds of their hit. maybe track who did the most damage if theres multiple

# flying

- GOAL: pure movement, transition between short/med/long
- 
- notify on reach lethal velocity for wall/floor hit??? or remove that entirely
- DONE-ISH: let players have more air control, while still requiring them to be grounded
  - done via wind charges. have to be near wall = more vulnerable
- higher gravity? limited rockets per air? higher knockback from skull/fireball?
- tunnel via breaking blocks while gliding?

# bow

- GOAL: good medium, inaccurate long, bad slow for short
- 
- arrow explode strength stronger for faster arrow. this makes spamming short range really hard
- bigger hitbox for flying players so you can hit them. but they stick to walls to go up, so explosion damage makes them more vulnerable there too
- cooldown on bow shots? overpowered
- 
- MAKE PLAYERS IN AIR WEAKER
    - already done needing to be near wall -> explosion radius -> die
    - make them bigger in air?
    - make arrows hit in air if near? teleport or just do explosion radius
    - !!!knock out of sky if not direct hit
    - okay rn this is way too powerful
    - made it just knock, no explode. brings em down. we fight on ground

# tnt

- GOAL: good for short, bad for long. mostly a cheeky funny item, something different from bow
- 
- arrows have no gravity, weaker explosion. tnt have gravity like grenade, stronger explosion
- short/medium range big explosion guy
- tnt left click to throw
- snow in ground, tnt too maybe occasionally. this means ability to break blocks instead of shoot skull
- big explosion = you die. how to fix?? smaller precision explosion
- 
- air shot? just do arrow logic but explode.
  - this might throw balance off for diving in with mace? or could be cool counter 
  - could just reflect arrow instead? counter
- explode after seconds for cool kill and prevent long range?
  - or just make it longer between shots
- might be too hard to escape? so if u shoot it the other person just dies lol
  - or make it counterable with arrow (ie shoot tnt to make it explode early)

# trident

- GOAL: get em out of short range
- 
- cause fire ticks, harms flying significantly. could make it random velocity on fire tick too
- reason for melee weapon? make it knockback. this should make it possible to hit and then impair their movement. could chain well with range -> use ranged weapon
  - also counters someone flying into you?
- this is a salmon now. bigger range to make it slap better. fire ticks might not impair movement enough rn
- could slap arrows/tnt for counter there
- okay we do that now, now its just this and avoiding that counters tnt

# mace

- GOAL: move you to med/long, general movement, melee hit at close at speed. pairs well with flying
- 
- wind charge
  - GOOD: wind charges work really well. explosion on arrow is more forgiving then insta kill perfect aim move wind charge to separate item to enforce switch? UPDATE: kinda meh custom wind charge hit response (manually set velocity). rn its kinda finicky. I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO DO THIS CURRENTLY
- wider range for mace hit. bounce. will try. might want a way to block?
  - also counters someone just standing under you to try and get you? maybe?

# wither skull?
- tunneling?
- also u can pepper someone until they die
- also wither effect 30 seconds :(
- kinda makes bow obselete?
- okay now its just tunneling thats it
